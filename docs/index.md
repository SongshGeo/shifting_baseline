# Past1000

A comprehensive Python library for analyzing historical climate reconstruction data and comparing it with collective memory records from historical documents.

## Overview

Past1000 is designed to bridge the gap between objective climate reconstructions and subjective historical records. The library provides tools for:

- **Data Processing**: Loading and standardizing climate reconstruction data from various sources
- **Historical Analysis**: Processing and analyzing historical drought/flood records
- **Statistical Comparison**: Advanced correlation analysis between different data sources
- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Simulating how historical observers might have recorded climate events
- **Calibration**: Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of different data sources

## Key Features

### üî¨ Scientific Analysis
- Advanced statistical methods for climate data analysis
- Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty quantification
- Multiple correlation analysis techniques (Pearson, Kendall, Spearman)
- Time series filtering and windowing methods

### üìä Data Integration
- Support for multiple climate reconstruction datasets
- Historical document processing and classification
- Spatial and temporal data aggregation
- Standardized data formats and interfaces

### ü§ñ Agent-Based Modeling
- Climate observer simulation framework
- Collective memory modeling
- Bias analysis in historical recording
- Behavioral pattern simulation

### üìà Visualization
- Comprehensive plotting utilities
- Statistical visualization tools
- Interactive correlation analysis plots
- Publication-ready figure generation

## Quick Start

```python
from past1000 import HistoricalRecords, load_data
from past1000.compare import experiment_corr_2d
from past1000.calibration import MismatchReport

# Load historical records
history = HistoricalRecords(
    shp_path="data/regions.shp",
    data_path="data/historical_data.xlsx",
    region="ÂçéÂåóÂú∞Âå∫"
)

# Load climate reconstruction data
datasets, uncertainties, _ = load_data(config)

# Perform correlation analysis
corr_df, r_benchmark, ax = experiment_corr_2d(
    data1=history.aggregate("mean"),
    data2=climate_data,
    corr_method="kendall"
)

# Generate mismatch report
report = MismatchReport(
    pred=classified_predictions,
    true=classified_observations,
    value_series=raw_data
)
report.analyze_error_patterns()
```

## Installation

```bash
# Using Poetry (recommended)
poetry install

# Or using pip
pip install -e .
```
